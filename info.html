    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>

    <p>Bushwig is an award winning two-day boutique performance & music festival at
    Knockdown Center, Queens.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Bushwig festival of Drag, Music & Love is committed to fostering innovation and
    creativity in performance. Our mission is to provide a space to showcase new talent, as
    well as build a community focused around art and music. Bushwig has grown
    rampantly since its inception in 2012, each year we have doubled our attendance.
    Beginning as a one day festival and growing into two full days with satellites in multiple
    cities, Bushwig continues to expand programming. We like to think our attendees do
    not just go to a festival, they join a family.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our mission is to change the face of queer event culture. It’s this uniqueness that
        makes Bushwig a wondrous world of discovery and adventure that will inspire
        creativity, community, drag, love, music and dancing not only in September, but all year
        round...

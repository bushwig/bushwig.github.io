    <h2>Bushwig 2017: The GAG Stage</h2>
    <p>
        The GAG Stage is the main stage of Bushwig. The seat of big name queens & the best international & local drag talent. Situated in the main room of the venue and host to headliners and heavy hitters, this is where the joys of drag really come alive. From breezy daytime treats to dazzling night time spectacles with fantastic production, lighting and NON-STOP-SHOWS.
